# 2.5: Sum Lists:
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in the reverse order such that the first digit is the head of the list. Write a function that adds two num-bers and returns the sum as a linked list. 
Example: 
Input: (7-> 1-> 6) +( 5-> 9-> 2) that is 617 + 295
Output: 2-> 1-> 9. That is 912
Follow-up: Suppose the digits are stored in the forward order, repeat the above problem.
Example: 
Input: (6-> 1-> 7) +( 2-> 9-> 5) that is 617 + 295
Output: 9-> 1-> 2. That is 912
