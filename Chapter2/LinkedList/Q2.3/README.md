# 2.3: Delete Middle Node:
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of singly linked list, given any access to that node. 
EXAMPLE
Input: the node c from the lined list a->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
