# 2.4: Partition:
Write a code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the “right partition”; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions. 
Example: 
Input: 3-> 5-> 8-> 5-> 10-> 2-> 1 [partition = 5]
result: 3-> 1-> 2-> 10-> 5-> 5-> 8 [partition = 5]
