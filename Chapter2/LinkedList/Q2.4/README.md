# 2.4: Partition:
Write a code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
before all nodes greater than or equal ro x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need
"right partition"; it does not need to apprear between the left and right partitions.
EXAMPLE
Input:    3->5->8->5->10->2->1 [partition = 5]
Output: 3->1->2->10->5->5->8
